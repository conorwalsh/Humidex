# Humidex
The humidex (short for "humidity index") is a scale used to describe how hot the weather feels to the average person, by combining the effect of heat and humidity. (This is the Canadian Humidex not the American Heat Index).

You can see the PHP example code in action <a href="http://www.conorwalsh.net/algorithms/humidex/" target="_blank">here</a>.

I originally wrote this software as part of an Internet of Things project that I was working on in the Summer 2015 and I could not find PHP code that could calculate Humidex so I have published my own version.

Thank you for taking the time to look at this project I hope that it is of use to you,<br/>
